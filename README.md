# Project 1: Wild West Shooting Game

##Tuesday:

As first step of the project, I used Trello for planning the whole project in details.

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/88ryxjNP)

I started creating a coulpe of lists called ***Ideas*** and ***Extra Features***.

While I was diving into the project details, I quickly reorganised all the Trello Board since reaching the final result linked above.

The colors of the Trello items represent their **priority**.  
  

While I was planning I also searched for the background image because all the layout is based on it.

I also searched for the images for the charaters appearing on the screen in order to be able to style quickly the first MVP as soon as it was finished.
